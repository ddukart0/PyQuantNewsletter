By putting these on a chart, we can immediately see if any hidden patterns remain—maybe days when the price jumped in an unusual way. Consistent, small values would mean our model captures risks well, while larger or patterned spikes could mean there's more beneath the surface. This last view helps us decide how much trust to put in the model's results."
